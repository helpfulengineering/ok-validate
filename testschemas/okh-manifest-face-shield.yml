  Description of the faceshield
  Helpful Engineering (HE) has designed new, low-cost, disposable facial protection (the Origami Face Shield).
  Small scale production cost is $0.88 USD each. Mass production drives unit cost to around $0.55 USD.
  This design is production ready, validated, and easy to scale.
  These shields can be both mass and locally produced in all 50 states and ship flat, allowing for fast delivery.
