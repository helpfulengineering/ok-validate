title: CoVisor Mk II Protective Face Shield
description: The CoVisor Mk II Protective Face Shield is a clear plastic shield that is
  held on the user's head by means of a Head Band and Adjustable Strap. The
  Clear Screen provides a physical barrier which prevents airborne droplets
  making contact with the userâ€™s face and eyes, where they may cause infection.
  The face shield requires assembly before use (see Assembly Instructions).
  Other PPE is also required to protect against airborne biological hazards. The
  CoVisor Mk II has been designed to be compatible with most types of PPE such
  as protective face masks, however compatibility with different PPE products
  should be checked before the CoVisor Mk II is used.
